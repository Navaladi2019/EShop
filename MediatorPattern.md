# Mediator Pattern and Pipeline Behaviours

This document explains the Mediator pattern and its application in conjunction with pipeline behaviors, particularly within the context of request processing in complex applications.

## Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern is particularly useful in complex or enterprise-level applications where request processing often involves more than just core business logic. It helps manage interactions between multiple objects by encapsulating how objects interact. This prevents objects from referring to each other explicitly, thereby reducing coupling.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Handling a request in an application frequently requires **additional steps** beyond just the main business logic. These steps are known as **cross-cutting concerns** and can include:

* **Logging:** Recording events and operations for auditing or debugging.
* **Validation:** Ensuring that input data meets specified criteria.
* **Auditing:** Tracking changes or accesses for security and compliance.
* **Security Checks:** Applying authentication and authorization rules.

## Pipeline Behaviours

* **Mediator Pipeline:** Frameworks like MediatR (as implied by the diagram) provide a mediator pipeline where these cross-cutting concerns can be inserted transparently.
* **Coordinating Request Handling:** A pipeline coordinates the request handling process, ensuring that all necessary steps (including cross-cutting concerns) are executed in the right order.
* **Implementation of Cross-Cutting Concerns:** In libraries like MediatR, pipeline behaviors are specifically used to implement cross-cutting concerns.
* **Wrapping Request Handling:** These behaviors wrap around the core request handling, allowing you to execute logic **before** (Pre-Processor Behavior) and **after** (Post-Processor Behavior) the actual handler for the request is called.
